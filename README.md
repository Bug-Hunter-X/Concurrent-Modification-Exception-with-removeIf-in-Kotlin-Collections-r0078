This repository demonstrates a common Kotlin code error related to the `removeIf` function and concurrent modification of collections. The `bug.kt` file showcases the problem, highlighting how using `removeIf` while iterating can lead to inconsistencies in the collection's contents. The `bugSolution.kt` file provides a safe and effective way to handle the removal of elements from collections while avoiding concurrent modification errors.
